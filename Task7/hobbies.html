      <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
      <p>Here are some of my hobbies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hiking</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Playing guitar</li>
        <li>Cooking</li>
        <li>Photography</li>

      </ul>
      <p>I enjoy spending my free time engaging in these activities. Hiking allows me to connect with nature and explore new trails. Reading helps me relax and escape into different worlds. Playing guitar is a passion of mine, and I often spend hours practicing and learning new songs. Cooking is both a hobby and a way for me to express my creativity in the kitchen. Photography allows me to capture special moments and express myself visually. Gardening is a peaceful and rewarding hobby that allows me to nurture and care for plants.</p>
